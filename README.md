Scenario
Background
AIT Research (AITR) is a market research company that allows people from the general
public to register their personal details, buying habits etc. with AITR and then sends these
respondents to market research jobs, based on the needs of AITR’s clients.
Currently, AITR asks respondents to email their details and maintains these manual emails.
To find all respondents who match the client’s needs, staffs at AITR look through the emails
to find respondents who match the criteria – for example, Males between the ages of 24 to 29
who are interested in Horse Racing Sport and Asia travel. Or, Females who use Westpac as
one of their banks.
AITR want to move to a web-based system where respondents can register their details
online, and staff can then search through these registrations to find respondents who match
the requested criteria.

• The user interface for respondents and staff should be Web based
